Maximum Mismatch problem: You are given a string S of length N. You can select and reverse any substring of S of any length. You are allowed to perform this operation many numbers of times. Determine the maximum number of mismatches by performing the operation.

Mismatch(S) is defined as the number of corresponding positions where characters are different in S and reverse(S). For example : S = abab, reverse(S) = baba. A number of mismatches = 4. S= abca. A number of mismatches = 2.

The Longest Prime Sub-array: Given an array arr[] of N integers, the task is to find the longest sub-array where all numbers in that sub-array are prime.

In order to pass all the test cases, you should have the knowledge of the sieve of Eratosthenes.
